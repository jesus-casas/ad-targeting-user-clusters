# AD Targeting Users For Sponsor
Welcome to my project AD targeting user clusters! The goal here is to create meaningful clusters of social media users to help a sponsor deliver more personalized and effective ads. Using data from 1,000 synthetic users along with the images they’ve posted. I grouped users into 4 distinct clusters based on their behavior and preferences. Each group is then analyzed to highlight what factors make them unique, so the sponsor can design ads that resonate with each audience.

## Dataset characteristics:
The dataset contains 1000 users called `synthetic social media users.csv`. Each row
corresponds to a user and the last picture the user posted is available in the folder ”posted
images” the name of the figures are ”imageX.jpg”, where X is the number
corresponding to the user.

## Steps Taken
### Step 1: Exploring the Dataset

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing

### Step 3: Standardized

### Step 4: Model using K-Means

### Step 5: Evaluating and Visualizing the Clusters
